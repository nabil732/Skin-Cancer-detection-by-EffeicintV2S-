# Skin-Cancer-detection-by-EffeicintV2S-
 This project develops a DL model for skin lesion classification using EfficientNetV2S enhanced with ECA and SE attention mechanisms. The model is trained on the HAM10000 dataset to detect three skin cancer types: BCC, MEL, and NV and uses Focal Loss to handle dataset imbalance. It achieves up to 97% training accuracy and 93–97% validation accuracغ
